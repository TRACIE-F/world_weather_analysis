# World Weather Analysis #

## Overview of Weather Analysis ##
This analysis utilized APIs from Google and World Weather to:
  * randomly generate a list of cities worldwide
  * locate nearby hotels
  * narrow down a list of potential vacation destinations by local temperature
  * choose 4 destinations within the above parameters and map out the trip

## Travel Plans ##
With a list of randomly generated cities and their nearby hotesl, I chose to set my desired vacation temperature between 40 and 80 degrees. Below is the heatmap indicating where those destinations ended up being located.

I chose to plot out a North American road trip, traveling between Port Hardy	in Canada, Portland and Pacific Grove in the USA, Sept-ÃŽles in Canada, before traveling back to Port Hardy in Canada.
